# Imperial MSc Computing (Conversion) – Prep Portfolio

This repository tracks my prep for Imperial: maths fundamentals and core algorithms, plus small Python snippets.

## Structure
- `Computer Science/` – CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (changed from last weeks algorithms as I need to build my fundamentals foundation more).
- `maths/` – concise notes and scanned handwritten evidence.
- `STUDY_LOG.md` – dated entries of what I covered and produced.

E  = gsBasis(bearBasis)          # 2x2 orthonormal columns
TE = np.array([[1., 0.],
               [0.,-1.]])        # reflect across first axis
T  = E @ TE @ E.T

# Induction Proof
\textbf{Claim.} For the sequence $x_{i+1}=6x_i-8x_{i-1}$ with $x_1=4$, $x_2=13$,
we have $x_i>0$ for all $i\ge 1$.

\textbf{Proof (strong induction with strengthened IH).}
Let $P(i)$ be: $(x_i>0)$ and $(x_i \ge 2x_{i-1}\text{ for }i\ge 2)$.

\emph{Base cases.} $x_1=4>0$. Also $x_2=13>0$ and $x_2\ge 2x_1$ since $13\ge 8$.

\emph{Inductive step.} Assume $P(k)$ holds for all $2\le k\le i$ (with $i\ge 2$).
Then $x_i>0$ and $x_i\ge 2x_{i-1}$, so $x_{i-1}\le \tfrac{1}{2}x_i$.
Hence
\[
x_{i+1}=6x_i-8x_{i-1}\ \ge\ 6x_i - 8\!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}x_i\right)
= 2x_i \ >\ 0.
\]
Thus $x_{i+1}>0$ and $x_{i+1}\ge 2x_i$, so $P(i+1)$ holds.

By strong induction, $x_i>0$ for all $i\ge 1$. \qed

- **Reflection in a plane**: \( r' = E * T_E * E^{-1} * r )
- **Proof by Induction**: Proof (we'll use), Base Case(more than 1), Inductive step (suppose), By the inductive process (proofs algebra), Completes inductive step (since LHS we have RHS)
